It removes commands which ledto errors, retains comments, and handles long lines which were wrapped byStata. The file ^logfilename^ must be a the name of a ^log^ file (without itsextension). The resulting ^do^ file has the same name, but an extension of.do. This command must be run on with an empty data set.Options-------^replace^ must be specified to overwrite and already existing ^do^ file.Examples--------    ^logtodo mylog^     will take the ^log^ file ^mylog.log^, and create the ^do^ file    ^mylog.do^. If the file ^mylog.do^ already exists, ^logtodo^ will complain and    exit.    ^logtodo mylog, replace^    will take the ^log^ file ^mylog.log^, and create the ^do^ file ^mylog.do^. If the    file ^mylog.do^ already exists, ^logtodo^ will overwrite it.Notes----- While ^logtodo^ can handle most situations well, clever Stata programmers will beable to create situations where it fails by creating lines in the log filewhich mimic lines which Stata produces. Commands like ^disp ". nonsense"^ or^disp "r(666);"^ or ^disp "> hee hee"^ will all cause logtodo to stumble. What twistedmind would be entering such commands while creating a log file?Author------Bill RisingDepartment of BiostatisticsJohns Hopkins Universitybrising@@jhsph.edu(410) 955-2468
