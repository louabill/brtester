{smcl}{hline}help for {hi:reshape7}{right: Bill Rising}{hline}{hi:A slightly improved reshape}	{cmd:reshape7} is identical to {cmd:reshape} in all respects exceptfor one improvement: it preserves variable labels when goingfrom long to wide and back to long. Its usage is identical, so see{help reshape} for syntax information.{title:Author}Bill Rising email: {browse "mailto:brising@louisville.edu":brising@louisville.edu} web: {browse "http://www.louisville.edu/~wrrisi01":http://www.louisville.edu/~wrrisi01}{title:Last Updated}: September 5, 2002 @ 12:34:15
