This aids compartimentilization ofado files... especially when building complicated batch processes.{p_end}{p}If a {cmd:slog using} command is not balanced with a {cmd:slog close} command, the output is sent to places unintended. If there is a problem, typing {cmd:slog flush} closes any open log file,and puts the logging back to its virgin state. Mixing {cmd:slog} and {help log} commands cancause havoc if a {help log} command is mistakenly balanced by a {cmd:slog close} command. So... it would bebest to simply use the {cmd:slog} commands.{p_end}{p}When using {cmd:slog} in ado files (its main use), the following usage isrecommended in order to avoid the above balancing problem:{p_end}    {cmd:slog using} {it:filename}    {cmd:capture n }{        Stuff to be logged into {it:filename}        {cmd:}}    {cmd:local rc = _rc}    {cmd:slog close}    {cmd:if `rc' }{        {cmd:exit `rc'}        {cmd:}}{title:Author}Bill Rising email: {browse "mailto:brising@louisville.edu":brising@louisville.edu} web: {browse "http://www.louisville.edu/~wrrisi01":http://www.louisville.edu/~wrrisi01}snailmail:Dept. of Family and Community MedicineUniversity of LouisvilleMedCenter One, Suite 270501 E.
